      "description": "About Metomic\n\nOver the last ten years, SaaS has changed the way we work — for the better. Slack instead of email. Miro instead of sticky notes. Airtable instead of Excel. SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but it’s also introducing a new surface area of risk they’ve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team down.\n\nAt Metomic, we help companies protect sensitive data in SaaS applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.\n\nOur technology connects to SaaS applications, detects the most critical sensitive data risks, and put automated policies in place to ensure these risks don’t happen again in the future.This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.\n\nAfter launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world’s most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Octopus Energy and Crypto.com. In 2023 we raised a $20m Series A round led by Evolution Equity and backed by other investors such Connect (investors in CityMapper, Typeform, Marvel), LocalGlobe (Improbable, Figma, Zego) and RFC (Hopin, Clubhouse, On Deck, etc), and Resonance.vc.\n\nEngineering Team\n\nAs we continue to change the way companies deal with their sensitive data, our Engineering Team (currently 8 strong) is growing and we’re looking to welcome Software Engineers, either back-end or full-stack, to our team to be part of this journey.\n\nSome of the areas you may be working on: Our sensitive data and classification engine, building systems to allow us to process billions of messages a day, data ingest pipelines, sensitive data remediation system, risk identification and ranking engines and alerting systems.\n\nOur back-end services are written in Typescript and make extensive use of Kafka, GraphQL and Postgres. Our front-end is written in React/TypeScript. Our house style is grounded in functional programming principles. We use AWS ECS Fargate via github actions and Terraform to deploy to production multiple times a day.\n\nRequirements\n\n\n * Product-minded and pragmatic engineers - Front of mind for you is thinking through what the best solution is for the problem the customer is facing. You’ll be given a lot of autonomy to explore solutions from what we build, how it’s designed and what technologies we use\n * Problem-solvers - We’re facing a lot of previously uncharted territory and with that a set of new and unseen challenges. You’re not one to shy away from tackling these sorts of problems. You’ll think through not just how to solve a problem, but what caused the problem in the first place and how we can make improvements to prevent similar problems in the future\n * One eye on now, one eye on what’s next - Our engineers have a passion for bringing to life distributed systems and scalable and robust architectures. You’ll have a huge role in coming up with how the system will evolve from an architecture and engineering standpoint\n * Culture contributors - We’re a small, close-knit team and recognise the importance of our culture as we continue to grow. You’ll be pivotal in helping shape the early stages and building a team platform that we can grow from\n   \n   \n\nWe encourage applications from all backgrounds, communities and industries and we are happy to discuss any reasonable adjustments that you require.\n\nAs an equal opportunity employer, we are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. Metomic does not discriminate based on age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion/belief, sex, sexual orientation. Every employment is based on qualification, excellence, and business need. Metomic is deeply committed to diversity, equity and inclusion both in our hiring practices and in our experiences as Metomic employees. We strive to create a mindful and respectful environment where everyone can bring their authentic self to work and experience a culture that is free of harassment and discrimination.\n\nBenefits\n\nLife as a Metonaut\n\n\n * Remote Working - We’re remote-friendly and also have an office in Shoreditch, London that you can work from at anytime\n * Our success is your success, so you’ll receive equity in Metomic (under our tax-efficient EMI options scheme)\n * Private Health Insurance - Enrolled from Day 1 through Vitality, for when life happens\n * Holiday Leave - 30 days holiday leave, excluding bank holidays\n * WFH Budget - £400 one-off contribution to your home office\n * Unforgettable events - Annual team trip away. We have recently been to Barcelona! (previous years have been a castle near Marseille, a penthouse in Lisbon, and a farm in South Downs, UK\n   \n   ",

Our mission is to incentivize investment in real climate action.\n\nPurchasing credits through the carbon markets is one of the most established and scalable ways to channel finance from the private sector to effective climate solutions and work toward societal net zero. Unfortunately, the voluntary carbon markets have been plagued with mistrust and a lack of effectiveness since they’ve emerged – until Sylvera.\n\nTo help organizations ensure they're making the most effective investments, Sylvera builds software that independently and accurately automates the evaluation of carbon projects that capture, remove, or avoid emissions. With Sylvera's data and tools, businesses and governments can confidently invest in, benchmark, deliver, and report real climate impact.\n\nOur team is made up of the leading minds in climate change from scientists to academics. We work in partnership with scientific organisations, universities, governments and think tanks to develop and test rigorous and holistic ratings methodologies, leveraging the latest technology.

Trusted by Governments and world-leading pharma institutions and funded with a over $70m we are on a mission to harness the power of connected data and bring precision medicine to life globally. The key to saving human lives is providing researchers across the globe with the right data to develop more precise drugs faster.\n\n\n\n\nGenerating large amounts of biomedical data has become relatively straightforward. The challenge now is finding, accessing and analysing this sensitive data stored across thousands of disconnected locations. It is frustrating and painfully difficult for researchers.\n\n\n\n\nLifebit has created a patented, federated technology that brings analysis and computation to where data resides. This enables researchers to run analyses on multiple, distributed datasets in-situ, avoiding the risky movement of highly-sensitive data.\n\n\n\n\nLifebit powers pioneers in national precision medicine such as Genomics England (UK Government) and the Hong Kong Genome Project and guides them on how to make their valuable data usable securely.

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nSoftware Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organisations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Apollo, or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organisation is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties.\n\nSWE Principles Include\n\n\n * Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.\n * Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.\n * Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team.\n   \n   \n\nTechnologies We Use\n\nSkills\n\nIt doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university TA, switched to CS recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:\n\n\n * A variety of languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend\n * Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, Elasticsearch, React, and Redux\n * Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub\n   \n   \n\nWhat We Value\n\n\n * Ability to communicate and collaborate with a variety of individuals, including engineers, users and non-technical team members.\n * Willingness to learn and make decisions independently, and the ability to ask questions when stuck.\n   \n   \n\nWhat We Require\n\n\n * Engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics.\n * Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.\n * Experience coding in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.\n   \n   \n\nTo Apply, Please Submit The Following\n\n\n * An updated resume / CV\n * Thoughtful responses to our application questions\n   \n   \n\nOffer Deadline\n\nIn an effort to build more transparency into our recruitment process, we’d like to share our offer deadline expectations. By applying to this position, you commit to confirming your decision within two weeks of receiving your written offer.\n\nLife at Palantir\n\nWe want every Palantirian to achieve their best outcomes, that’s why we celebrate individuals’ strengths, skills, and interests, from your first interview to your longterm growth, rather than rely on traditional career ladders. Paying attention to the needs of our community enables us to optimize our opportunities to grow and helps ensure many pathways to success at Palantir. Promoting health and well-being across all areas of Palantirians’ lives is just one of the ways we’re investing in our community. Learn more at Life at Palantir and note that our offerings may vary by region.\n\nIn keeping consistent with Palantir’s values and culture, we believe employees are “better together” and in-person work affords the opportunity for more creative outcomes. Therefore, we encourage employees to work from our offices to foster connectivity and innovation. Many teams do offer hybrid options (WFH a day or two a week), allowing our employees to strike the right trade-off for their personal productivity. Based on business need, there are a few roles that allow for “Remote” work on an exceptional basis. If you are applying for one of these roles, you must work from the state in which you are employed. If the posting is specified as Onsite, you are required to work from an office.\n\nPalantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems.\n\nPalantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone.

Since launch, our services have eliminated trillions of dollars of gross notional through interest rate compression and billions of dollars in initial margin and capital requirements through counterparty risk optimisation.\n\n\n\n\nOur clients, including all the top tier global banks, regional banks, buy-side firms and other large institutional market participants, are serviced from offices in London, New York and Amsterdam – with Tokyo coming soon.\n\n\n\n\nAs a graduate in the engineering team, you'll have the opportunity to collaborate on cutting-edge solutions and make an impact on meaningful projects, including designing and enhancing our services and analysing the results.\n\n\n\n\nOur services can be expressed mathematically as solutions to constrained convex optimisation problems. You'll work on converting real world financial data to solve such problems, ultimately delivering clients a set of actionable trades which can be used to optimise their portfolios. Our technology stack is predominantly JavaScript and Python and runs on the public cloud.\n\n\n\n\nThe application development team creates the systems that deliver the service to Quantile's clients. It is this team's responsibility to design and build systems that permit financial market participants to securely provide risk and trade data to Quantile, to deliver that data into the quantitate algorithms developed by the quants, and to return the output of those libraries safely back to the participants in a timely manner. In addition, the systems should provide feedback to the clients to help them to understand the results as well as how they can modify their parameters and data to gain improvements in the future. The Quantile systems live in the cloud, currently hosted by AWS.\n\n\n\n\nThe successful candidate will work as part of a small team of 5-7 developers to build and research improvements to the applications & environment. They will work directly with product management team to enhance the product based on feedback from clients and analysis of runs as well as on strategic projects. Examples of possible projects, all of which will involve writing a program in python, include\n\n\n\n\n * Design and build a Data Masking Tool to allow us to generate data-sets for development and testing without compromising real client data\n * Simulate the creation and evolution of a compression scenario to automate parts of the QA process performed by products team\n * Build a chat-bot to post messages to our internal chat room regarding status of runs and application infrastructure\n\n\n\n\nDesired skills:\n\n\n\n\n * Current MSc/MEng student in a STEM discipline\n * Solid understanding of python for executable & repeatable programs (as opposed to data analytics). In particular, familiarity with pandas, numpy & dask\n * Experience with the unix command line\n * Some experience with AWS\n * Knowledge of Interest Rate Swaps\n * Excellent communication & problem solving skills\n * Knowledge of Interest Rate Swaps\n * Excellent problem-solving skills\n\n\n\n\nThis role is a hybrid working role, with a blended approach of home and office working.\n\n\n\n\nQuantile is an Equal Opportunity Employer.\n\n\n\n\nLearn about Quantile's Values",
