## üí° Inspiration

Our inspiration for Matchify came from witnessing the frustration that job seekers experience when applying for positions. We wanted to create a solution that simplifies the process of customizing CVs for specific job requirements and empowers individuals in their job search.

## ü§ñ What it does

Matchify streamlines the CV customization process. It allows users to search for a job they want to apply to, and our platform provides real-time recommendations to align their CV with specific job requirements. It empowers job seekers and increases their chances of landing their ideal job.

## üîß How we built it

We built Matchify using a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Our team collaborated to design an intuitive user interface and develop the algorithms that analyze job descriptions and provide tailored recommendations.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Challenges we ran into

We encountered several challenges during the development of Matchify. One significant hurdle was selecting the right backend framework, as we weighed the advantages of Node.js for OpenAI integration and PHP for efficient file type conversion. Ultimately, we opted for PHP, a decision that required thorough consideration and teamwork. Additionally, we faced the task of finding a suitable job listing API to integrate into Matchify, a process that involved research and evaluation to ensure that our platform provides users with the most up-to-date job listings and requirements. These challenges reinforced the importance of informed technical decision-making and perseverance in overcoming obstacles.

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of
 
We're proud of creating a tool that empowers job seekers to customize their CVs efficiently. Our accomplishment lies in simplifying a previously time-consuming process and enhancing job application success rates.

## üìú What we learned

Throughout the project, we learned the importance of user-centered design and the value of real-time data analysis. We also gained insights into the challenges faced by job seekers and the potential for technology to make a positive impact.

## üòá What's next for Matchify

In the future, we plan to expand Matchify's capabilities, including additional features for job seekers. We aim to enhance the user experience further and potentially partner with job listing platforms to offer seamless integration. Our goal is to continue helping job seekers secure their dream jobs with ease.
